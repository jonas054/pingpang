# Ping Pang

## Description
The classic Pong game implemented in Ruby with the Gosu library. See
Installation instructions on [The Gosu wiki](https://github.com/gosu/gosu/wiki)
for setting up Gosu.

## Background
The game was implemented during a vacation in China, so the name comes from the
Chinese word for ping-pong, 乒乓, which is spelled pīng pāng in
[pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).

## Game Play
It's a two player game. The left player uses `W` and `S` on the keyboard to move
the paddle, and `D` to serve. The right player uses `Up Arrow` and `Down Arrow` to
move and `Left Arrow` to serve.
